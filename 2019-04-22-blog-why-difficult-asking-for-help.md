# Why is it so difficult to ask for help?

My first blog is going to be personal stuff. You see, I decided that I want to learn coding mid-college. My initial leaning used to be towards Humanities (journalism in particular). Writing was the area I’ve been always comfortable in. I was good with words as long as I can remember myself. When I was still in preschool, I wanted to learn five different languages. I used to speculate what those languages might be. They ranged from French to Japanese. Yet they definitely never included JavaScript or Python.
So trying to get a grasp on coding was difficult. Yet it wasn’t so challenging intellectually when compared to how hard it was for me to be a complete newbie at something. Why? It meant starting from the square one, and, most frighteningly, asking for help. I was surprised at how difficult the latter have been for me and I started wondering why.
## It’s ingrained in our culture
First of all, our society is obsessed with self-help. We find it empowering to do everything alone and own our success (if we somehow manage to succeed in isolation, that is). Just google “self-help” and get a bucket of popcorn. Alternatively, go to the closest bookshop and find an eponymous section there (popcorn optional).

## We are not aware of the problem
Sometimes we don’t realize that we have a problem asking for help. We just sit there, trying to crack that nut of a problem, or stalling on a project because we think we can do it. We just need some time. Some more time. We don’t want to give up. Asking for help is giving up, right? We don’t want to be defeated. We want to solve this problem. For the fun of it. Even if it takes forever.
The problem is that when while we play for time and procrastinate instead of asking for help, we let our problem get out of hand and grow into a full-fledged crisis. 
Example. Many of my classmates were hesitant about going to see our instructor during her office hours about one particularly tricky writing assignment. They waited and waited. Some of them ended up getting [essay help online]( https://www.paperhelp.org/essay/), others eventually rushed to our instructor and to the college’s writing center when it was already too little time to complete the assignment before the deadline. They simply refused to acknowledge they needed help.
## We don’t want to seem weak
… or incompetent, or ridiculous, or needy. This is especially true for men because gender norms put qualities like self-reliance, confidence, and strength at the core of masculinity. Asking for help, even if we find ourselves in a really tough spot, seemingly negates those qualities (which it doesn’t really). So, when it comes to admitting even to ourselves that we need help – men are worse at it than women.

## We don’t want to lose control 
We don’t want to lose control over the situation and be reduced to a student, a helper, or worse still – a watcher in our own project. We are afraid maybe that we won’t get our due when it’s all over and trophies will be dealt out; that we won’t get the credit; that our name will come second or won’t appear in the title at all. We are afraid that one moment’s weakness will rob us of our future success.
If this is the case with you, you should check out the [benefits of being a team player]( https://www.collegerecruiter.com/blog/2015/07/14/10-qualities-of-an-excellent-team-player-at-any-workplace/). I see why you might be skeptical. If your experience is anything like mine, you think that working it a team is just the same as working alone. You do all the work, you don’t get the credit if everything goes well, but you will be blamed if things go south. Still, don’t let high-school projects experience spoil your professional life. On the other hand, if that is happening in your professional life – change the team. Something is definitely not right.
## We are afraid to be dependent
Also, we don’t want to feel in debt. “What will it cost me? What will this person want in return?” Asking for help may indeed shift the power balance. However, most people are glad to help you, feel good about it and won’t abuse this power. There are cases when it might cause problems, but they are rare: either the person asking for help doesn’t want to return the favor, of the helper refuses to accept help in return (we are talking about repeatedly reoccurring scenarios here; one-off unreciprocated help doesn’t make a pattern).
However difficult it might seem, I want you to know that asking for help is a normal human activity. Don’t be afraid to seem incompetent and immature because quite often, asking for help is the only responsible and adult thing to do.
